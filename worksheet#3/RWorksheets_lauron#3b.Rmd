#4 Interpret the graph
#The graph illustrates the count of tweets from July 14 to July 21, 2020, 
#categorized by sentiment type (positive, negative, and neutral).
#Based on the visualization, it is evident that negative sentiments dominate across
#all dates. The count of negative tweets started high on July 14 and peaked sharply
#on July 15, reaching approximately 4,000 tweets.Meanwhile,positive sentiment 
#consistently rank second as the neutral to last.
