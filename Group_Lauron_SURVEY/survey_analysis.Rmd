#A SURVEY ON TIME ON STUDYING AND STUDY HABITIS AMONG STUDENTS OF ISAT U (LAPAZ) 


#Import the responses in Google Form Data in CSV  to analyze it.

#The data set contains information about the personal information, 
#time allocatin for studying  and questions of the studying habits of -
#ISAT U students. Each column represents the questions to determine it.

head(surveyData)

#To inspect the dataset, the View() and head() functions were used.The View() 
#function allows examination of the entire dataset from Group_Lauron.csv, which 
#contains the respondents’ timestamps, demographic information (such as full name, 
#age, college, and gender), and responses to questions related to their study 
#habits. Meanwhile, the head() function displays the first six rows of the
#dataset, providing a quick overview of its structure and contents.

#In checking the structure, dimensions, and Class of the data.

str(surveyData)   
class(surveyData)   #to know the data type of the data.
dim(surveyData)     #to know the dimensions.

#In using str() and class(), We able to identify which class our data belong, 
#in str() we are able to identified what are the integer and the character on 
#the answers, in the data type, how many observation and variables.


#Converted the blank lines in our survey data to NA to make it clearer and complete,
#because we made the name question optional and a lot chose not to put their names.

#The results showed that most respondents were 19-year-old female students from
#the College of CCI. 
#The least number of respondents was shared among ten groups with different 
#combinations of age, gender, and college.

#We grouped the responses by gender, age, college, and all respondents based on 
#time allocation for studying to better understand and analyze the data. 
#This allowed us to identify which groups spent the most time studying based on 
#gender, age, and college.

#We also created table and bar graphs of the responses to determine the most 
#and least common study time allocations among respondents based on it.
#But first we arrange the Time Allocation logically for a better graph outcomes.

#CONCLUSION:
#INTERPRETATION ON QUESTIONS:

#1 Students sometimes allocate 30+ minutes; the typical student is 
#neutral-to-agree. Majority allocate some study time, but not consistently daily.
#2 Note-taking is a moderate habit; some students do it 
#more consistently than others.
#3 Advanced study is not a strong habit; many students may need 
#encouragement to explore challenging topics.
#4 Students often listen to music while studying.
#5 Some prefer group work while others prefer studying alone.
#6 Students do not consistently follow a schedule 
#Time management and planning could be improved.Prefer independent study and 
#often take short breaks to maintain focus.
#7 Technology is heavily integrated into their study routines.
#8 Some students manage distractions, others do not.
#9 Students often take breaks during long study sessions.
#10 Independent study is a dominant preference.

#OVERALL:
#Strong habits:
#Music while studying (Q4), using gadgets (Q7), taking breaks (Q9), 
#studying alone (Q10) → widely practiced.
#Moderate Habits:
#Allocating daily study time (Q1), taking notes (Q2), group study (Q5),
#avoiding distractions (Q8) → practiced sometimes, not consistently.
#Weak Habit:
#Creating and following a study schedule (Q6) → students do not
#consistently plan their study time.
#Advanced study (Q3) → students rarely go beyond regular study material.

#GENERAL CONCLUSIONS:
#Students at ISAT U (La Paz) generally:
#Rely heavily on gadgets and music while studying.
#Prefer independent study and often take short breaks to maintain focus.
#Are moderately consistent in allocating study time and note-taking, 
#but planning and advanced study habits are weaker.
#Group study and avoiding distractions show high variability, reflecting 
#individual differences in study style.

#Recommendation: Encourage structured study plans, advanced study practices, 
#and focus strategies to further improve students’ study effectiveness.
